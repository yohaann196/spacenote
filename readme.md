# Python Console Note-Taking App

A simple Python-based console note-taking app.  
Notes are saved to `notes.json` in the same folder as `main.py`, so they persist between sessions.

## Features
- Add, view, edit, and delete notes
- Persistent storage with JSON
- Interactive console menu
- Fully self-contained — no extra setup needed

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder (where `main.py` is located).
3. Run the app: python main.py OR python3 main.py
